    <p>Bhekizizwe Joseph Siphatimandla Mxoveni Mshengu Bigboy Shabalala, was a South African singer and musician from Ladysmith who was the founder and musical director of the choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.</p>
    <p>1958: he searched for work in the nearby city of Durban whereby he was spotted by a well-known group, the Durban Choir, after he delighted audiences with his smooth guitar playing and soprano voice. When he joined the choir, he attempted to teach them some of his new compositions, namely his first song "Nomathemba" (which was made into a play in 1995). They refused, and so he left them after only two years.</p>
    <p>1958: Shabalala discovered an isicathamiya group, The Highlanders, led by his hero Galiyane Hlatshwayo. Hlatshwayo was the man who encouraged Shabalala to use his voice powerfully<p>
        <p>1959: Shabalala formed his own group called Ezimnyama "The Black Ones".</p>
        <p>1960: He had a series of dreams in his sleep in December 1960 was a major turning point in the formation of the group; when he saw how well his group did in the once-weekly isicathamiya competitions, he renamed them Ladysmith Black Mambazo, "Mambazo" meaning axe, referring to how the group chopped down the other choirs by winning almost every time.<p>
            <p>1972: After local radio airplay (on the S.A.B.C. station Radio Zulu), Shabalala accepted a recording contract that was offered by Gallo Music producer West Nkosi. The group sold over 40,000 copies of their first album and continued to do so through other recordings.</p>
            <p>1976: He became a Christian, and the songs in the Mambazo repertoire were shuffled to one side to include generalized Christian, Methodist, and Zionist hymns sung in the Zulu language.</p>
            <p>1986: Paul Simon travelled to South Africa to collaborate with South African artists for his upcoming Graceland album. Simon collaborated with Shabalala and the group, and co-composed the now-famous song, "Homeless". The group's popularity spread all over the world, and since then they have sold records popular enough to earn platinum disc certification. In 1987, the group won their first solo Grammy Award for Shaka Zulu. Since then, they have won one more and have been nominated over ten times. Following the worldwide success of Graceland, Shabalala began composing more songs in English (prior to this they had only recorded two in English and one in German).</p>
            <p>2008: Shabalala announced, in January 2008, that his youngest son Thamsanqa would take over as leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo when the time comes for him to retire from international touring.</p>
            <p>2020: 11 February 2020, Shabalala died in Pretoria at the age of 78</p>
